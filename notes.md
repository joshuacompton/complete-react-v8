# Pure react
ReactDOM.createElement, render  -  will never be used because jsx does this
  possibly use if state needed to be imported from (ex angular or websocket)

react benefits
  good way to organize components
  handles state well
  not opinionated about data
  one way data flow makes things easy to follow


npm run lint -- --debug
  -- means that the following --debug will be passed to eslint and not npm


build tools
  webpack - is this still used?
  parcel - still valid https://parceljs.org/
  vite - standard for react
